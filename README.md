# Expressive/Deadpan Project

This paper contains the data and code used in Anderson, Ling, & Schutz (under review).

Analysis code is available as .qmd and .r files in /Analysis. To reproduce analyses from the paper, open Analysis.qmd. Data are contained in /Data. 
*R* dependencies and custom functions are viewable in /Functions/Functions.R. Functions.R and Setup.R are sourced within Analysis.qmd.
Figures from the analyses are viewable in /Figures.

To get started, open Expressive-Deadpan.Rproj from the repository, and then Analysis/Analysis.qmd to reproduce analyses.
